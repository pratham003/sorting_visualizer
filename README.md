# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer  

An engaging and interactive web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to visualize and understand popular sorting algorithms. This project is designed for students, developers, and educators to see how sorting techniques work step by step in a visually appealing manner.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Visualizations**: Bars dynamically update during the sorting process.  
- **Included Algorithms**:  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  - Generate new arrays with a single click.  
  - Start sorting with easy-to-use controls.  
  - Highlight swapped elements to visualize changes clearly.  
- **Customizable Options**: The code is adaptable for tweaking array size and animation speed.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web application.  
- **CSS**: Styles the UI for an enhanced visual experience.  
- **JavaScript**: Implements sorting logic and animations.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository to your local system:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratham003/sorting_visualizer.git
2. Open the project folder and launch `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Explore and experiment with sorting algorithms through the user-friendly interface!  

### Future Enhancements  
- Incorporate additional algorithms like Heap Sort and Radix Sort.  
- Add features to adjust array size and animation speed directly from the UI.  
- Upgrade the design with advanced themes and improved responsiveness.  

### Demo  
Experience the power of sorting algorithms through a sleek, interactive visualization tool.
